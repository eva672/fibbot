## FIBOT GITHUB ACTION
This documentation will help or guide you on the projects .


**INTRODUCTION**

Develop a GitHub Action in Rust that scans pull request content for numbers, calculates their Fibonacci numbers, and posts a comment with the results. The action will support two parameters (e.g., a flag to enable Fibonacci calculation and a threshold limit).

- Create a rust project from your terminal using the command ``cargo new fibbot``
- After creating the directory , run the command ``code .`` that will take directly in VSC make sure you are on your project directory
- To start the project you should create a Github repository where you will push your work
- After all been set you can start working on your project.

To give you like a small understanding of the project the following may be of help;

1. **GITHUB ACTIONS**
GitHub Actions enables automation of workflows directly in your GitHub repository, providing a way to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

**NB** : Take note that there is a difference between a Workflow and an action ;

<table>
<tr><th>Action</th><th>Workflow</th></tr>
<tr><td>an action is a specific task or operation within that workflow.</td><td>a workflow is a series of steps or actions designed to achieve a specific goal</td></tr>
<tr><td> is a reusable component that can be used within a workflow.</td><td>a workflow is a single file that defines a set of jobs and steps to be executed, triggered by specific events like a push or pull request. </td></tr>
<table>
Below are some key concepts concerning workflows;
**Key Concept**

- **Workflows**

A workflow is a unit in GitHub Actions. It defines a series of jobs that get triggered by specific events. Each workflow is defined in its own YAML file inside the ``.github/workflows/ ``directory of your repository.
Extract of a workflow;
  

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    - name: Run tests
      run: cargo test --verbose

 - **Action (action.yml)**

The metadata file, action.yml, is essential for defining a custom action. It contains information about the actionâ€™s behavior, inputs, and outputs.

- You can create an action.yml file in your GitHub repository.
- You now update your file to include the two parameters(precising their description ,requirement and default ).
- Implement input parsing in your rust code (i.e go into your rust code and impl the 2 parameters).
       
For all required demonstration it is been done by the either the workflow , Dockerfile or action provided you've implemented a function(rust code).

If you want to see all your action logs or a demonstration that your code is actually working or failing youve to do the following;

- when opening the github repository you will a bar of options .
- You chose the Action Option 
- When you are in the Action you click new action 
- They will show you different templates you chose one of them and configure it with any name you want
- For example if you take the rust template you can rename it to any name of your choice and work on it .
2. **DOCKER**
In this projects we will have to use Dockerfile which is a text file that contains instructions for building and configuring a Docker images.
**EXTRACTION**
Here is all about writing functions that will help in extraction of numerical values from a pull request(PR) .
You have to do the following;

- You have to write function that extracts only numbers in a mix string (meaning a string having both letters ,numbers ,special characters etc..)
- After writing that function
write another function for a fibonacci calculator that will calculate the fib number of numbers 
- If you want to run the code you can use ``cargo run`` if want to include pameters use ``cargo run "" ""``

**NB**:A fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

**COMBINATION**
Here you have to combine the two writen function so that your action should process a PR content,compute fibonacci numbers for extracted values and post a comment with the result.

- You can refer your self to the Github rest api using https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28
- You need a personal access token (PAT) that you can get from your repository settings on github.
**NB** : Make sure you PAT is private 

At the end of this documentation you shopuld able to have a fully functioning GitHub Action with a successful execution on pull requests.
